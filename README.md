Short Description: We intend to make a road information sytem based on mobile (primarily Android) devices, whereupon the image of a road, the road condition will be visualized by the users. Based on the app's data set, through the app, any user will be able to know how safe a road is for a certain vehicle and make decisions whether he or she wishes to use that road or not, before visiting the place. 

The android app platform we intend to make will be based on crowding with images of road conditions shared by any user, the app will let other users know about the road conditions. For a developing country like Bangladesh, the conditions of an average number of roads are not very praiseworthy. There are many roads where the conditions are too poor and passers-by, vehicle need to cross those roads willingly or unwillingly. In many places, Government representatives might not be well informed about the road conditions: like about manholes and other safety issues. But for any new visitor or traveler going through the road might fall into big problem suddenly for not knowing about the road's condition. Our app will let them know the condition beforehand. Also, the app can be used to send information to the Government portals responsible for road safety for their better information. Of course, the main challenge of the of the project is to build a large dataset to cover all the areas of the country. But we hope to overcome the challenge with google street view images and crowding which can be made better with time. We shall primarily work with the images of the roads of Bangladesh for the prototype. 
We are currently working to build a machine learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), where more features about the road can be pulled to let
the users know more detailed information on the roads.
